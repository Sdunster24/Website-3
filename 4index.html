    <h1><center>Life in Montana</center></h1>

  <h1>In Seeley Lake we play Class C 8 man football. We have not made playoffs in over 30 years until my senior season. We had a winning season and made it to playoffs. We lost in the first round but made history.</h1>

  <h2>I enjoy to hunt and fish and just like being outside. Our highschool was a class C school so the smallest in Montana. Everyone knows each other which has its pros and cons. But for the most part it is a good community that supports each other </h2>
