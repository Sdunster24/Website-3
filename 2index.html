    <h1><center>Life in Montana</center></h1>
  </header>
  <h1>I have lived in Montana my entire life from Colstrip to Missoula. I enjoy all the different wilderness it has to offer from the flats to the mountains. For my highschool years I ended up in Seeley Lake Montana, north of Missoula about an hour. I am really blessed to live in a place like this it fit my way of life.</h1>

  <h2>I enjoy to hunt and fish and just like being outside. Our highschool was a class C school so the smallest in Montana. Everyone knows each other which has its pros and cons. But for the most part it is a good community that supports each other </h2>
